        "1": {
          "question": "What is Chunky Crayon?",
          "answer": "Chunky Crayon is a magical coloring page generator designed for children and families. Simply describe what you want to color - like \"a dragon having a tea party\" or \"my favourite superhero on the moon\" - and we create a unique, printable coloring page in seconds. It's perfect for rainy days, quiet time, or sparking your child's imagination!"
        },
        "2": {
          "question": "Is it safe and appropriate for children?",
          "answer": "Absolutely! Chunky Crayon is built by parents, for parents. All generated images are designed to be child-friendly with age-appropriate content. Our AI is specially tuned to create wholesome, fun coloring pages suitable for children of all ages."
        },
        "3": {
          "question": "How do I create a coloring page?",
          "answer": "It's as easy as 1-2-3! Just type what you want to color (e.g., \"a unicorn in a magical forest\"), click Generate, and wait about 30 seconds. Your unique coloring page will appear ready to download and print. You can also use voice input or upload a photo for inspiration!"
        },
        "4": {
          "question": "How long does it take to generate a page?",
          "answer": "Most coloring pages are ready in about 30 seconds. Our friendly mascot Colo will keep you entertained while you wait! Complex scenes with lots of details might take a tiny bit longer."
        },
        "5": {
          "question": "Can I print the coloring pages?",
          "answer": "Yes! Every coloring page you create can be downloaded as a high-quality PDF, perfect for printing at home. The pages are optimised for A4 paper and look great with crayons, colored pencils, or markers."
        },
        "6": {
          "question": "What if my child's request doesn't work?",
          "answer": "Sometimes the AI might not get it quite right on the first try - that's part of the creative adventure! You can simply try again with slightly different words. Tips: be specific about what you want, and describe the scene clearly. If you're stuck, try our voice input - kids often explain things better by talking!"
        },
        "7": {
          "question": "Is Chunky Crayon free to use?",
          "answer": "You can try Chunky Crayon with 2 free generations - no account needed! After that, you can sign up for a free account to get 15 bonus credits, or choose one of our affordable subscription plans for unlimited creative fun."
        },
        "8": {
          "question": "What's included in the subscription plans?",
          "answer": "Our plans range from Crayon (perfect for casual coloring) to Studio (for super-creative families or teachers). All plans include: unlimited coloring page generation, high-quality PDF downloads, voice and photo input modes, and access to new features as we add them. Higher tiers include credit rollover and commercial use rights."
        },
        "9": {
          "question": "Can I use pages for my classroom or nursery?",
          "answer": "Yes! Teachers and childminders love Chunky Crayon. Our Crayon and Rainbow plans are perfect for personal and educational use. If you're running a business or want to distribute pages commercially, check out our Masterpiece or Studio plans which include commercial licensing."
        },
        "10": {
          "question": "How do credits work?",
          "answer": "Each coloring page you generate uses 5 credits. Credits refresh monthly with your subscription, and some plans allow unused credits to roll over. You can also purchase credit packs if you need a little extra creativity boost!"
